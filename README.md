# AnimePaheExtractor (please read last paragraph)
Coded like my first Hello World! Unstable as a teenager.
> *It's not like I wanna be stable or anything.*

## Usage

- Make sure you have at least .NET Framework 4.8 | https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net48
- Download the last artifact in the last commit from the master (or what ever it calls in the future)
- Launch it
- Pray while it loads (the first time puppeteer will download Chromium)
- Ingest some random garbage below
- Search for your needs (remember this is meant to download anime, potatoes are there in the store)
- Select a range of episodes
- Start the extraction
- Pray while it loads
- Fight against captcha (Maybe you did it before)
- Wait the extraction to finish, or something to break :3
- Close it, even if you want to extract more content, because programming.
- Do not abuse, animepahe is a thousand times better. There is no comment section, and that's what I love the most.
- Fork and do better, I demand justice against my acts.

It will extract everything in the program's root folder, inside a subfolder named like the series title

## Thoughts
I did (and do) this in a rush, so you should expect as many bad practices as you never saw before. I'm aware of it.

In the end, this ugly app is made for fun, I do not approve such an abomination to exist, and I use animepahe service as intended most of the time.
Go to support animepahe or, even better, pay for the content you watch, if you can afford it (there is content that isn't for sale, I know).

Have fun!.. main(args : Array<String>) { println("I'm learning Kotlin (´・ω・｀)\nHaha #comedy") }
